 * pi-audit-hypothesis-tree — extensions/hypothesis-tree/types.ts
 *
 * The data model. Read this file first: the whole extension is a consequence
 * of one decision — **a node is a falsifiable ASSERTION, not a task.**
 *
 * "Check whether the login handler validates the JWT signature" is a task. It
 * cannot be confirmed or rejected; it can only be "done", and a done task
 * produces no knowledge. "The login handler does not validate the JWT
 * signature" is a hypothesis: reading `src/auth/jwt.ts:41` either supports it
 * or refutes it, and either outcome is a durable fact about the codebase.
 *
 * Everything downstream depends on that distinction:
 *   - a node has a STATUS that is a verdict (confirmed / rejected), not a
 *     progress marker;
 *   - a node has EVIDENCE, because a verdict without raw evidence is an
 *     opinion;
 *   - a node has CHILDREN, because refuting "the handler validates the
 *     signature" immediately raises "then how is the signature trusted?" —
 *     the tree grows by falsification, not by decomposition.
